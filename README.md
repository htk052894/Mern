# React#Redux#Saga#BoilerPlate

<p>This is a MERN stack boiler plate application
<p>This project is created using Create React App and Express.js
<ul><strong>Features</strong>
<li>Using Redux Saga for state management</li>
<li>login, logout and private routes</li>
<li>Passport.js and JWT for authentication</li>
<li>express and mongoDB</li>
<li>React BootStrap</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Future Development</strong>
<li>Add Social Tools to authenticate using Passport</li>
<li>Replacing REST with graphQL</li>
</ul>
